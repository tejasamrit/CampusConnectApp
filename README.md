Campus Connect is a project designed to provide students with information about nearby PG
accommodations and mess facilities around colleges. The project aims to make it easier for
students to find suitable accommodation and food options within close proximity to their college.
The Campus Connect platform will utilize various technologies such as geolocation,
database management, and user interfaces to provide students with a seamless and efficient
experience. The platform will have a user-friendly interfacethat will allow students to search
for PG accommodations and mess facilities based ontheir location, budget, and other preferences.
The project will also allow PG and mess providers to register and create a profile on the
platform, enabling them to promote their services to students who are looking for accommodation
and food options.
Overall, the Campus Connect project will make the process of finding suitable PG
accommodations and mess facilities for students hassle-free,efficient, and convenient.
